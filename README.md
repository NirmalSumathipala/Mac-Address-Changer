# Mac-Address-Changer
A MAC address changing python script
There are several ways to change the MAC address of a network interface on a computer, and the specific method you use will depend on your operating system and hardware. Some common techniques include:

    Using command-line utilities: Many operating systems include command-line utilities that can be used to change the MAC address of a network interface. For example, on Linux systems, the "ip" utility can be used to change the MAC address of an interface using the following command:

sudo ip link set dev INTERFACE_NAME address NEW_MAC_ADDRESS

On Windows systems, the "netsh" utility can be used to change the MAC address of an interface using the following command:

netsh interface set interface "INTERFACE_NAME" physicaladdress=NEW_MAC_ADDRESS

    Modifying system settings: Some operating systems allow you to change the MAC address of a network interface by modifying the system settings. For example, on Windows systems, you can go to the "Network and Sharing Center" and click on the "Change adapter settings" link. From there, you can right-click on the network interface you want to change and select "Properties" from the context menu. In the Properties window, you can click on the "Configure" button and then go to the "Advanced" tab. From there, you should see an option to change the MAC address.

    Installing third-party software: There are also many third-party software tools available that can be used to change the MAC address of a network interface. These tools typically offer a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easier to change the MAC address without using command-line utilities or modifying system settings.

It is important to note that changing your MAC address may not always be legal or ethical, depending on the specific circumstances. You should be sure to understand any potential consequences before proceeding with a MAC address change.
